## [Helper Bot for TeamUp](https://www.val.town/v/rayman/mgsrBotEndpoint)
Discord bot built using [val.town](https://www.val.town/v/rayman/mgsrBotEndpoint). Takes user game results posted in a Discord channel and formats them as a /slash command usable with [TeamUp, a third-party bot](https://teamupdiscord.com/) for creating leaderboards for any game with Elo rankings. This Helper Bot eliminates the need to manually type out slash commands.  As of November 2023, this tool is used by a team numerous times per day in a mid-sized gaming server, after its creation in July 2023. This is the successor to the MGSR Discord web tool.

## [MGSR Team Up Results Utility](https://mr309.github.io/MGSR-TeamUp/mgsr/)
Web tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to aid game results entry with the TeamUp bot, which has its own syntax using Discord /slash commands. This tool uses a JavaScript form that takes in player names and their placements, then outputs a properly-formatted /slash command to input into the TeamUp bot in Discord. The web tool ensured consistency in recording game results because it eliminated potential errors when typing the /slash command manually. The tool initially had drop-downs and predictive search boxes for usernames, but I later added a text input which would take user-reported results and recognized the placements and players' names. This input used fuzzy matching for names and would recognize different placement number styles (e.g. #1, 1), 1 , (1), etc.)
