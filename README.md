## [Helper Bot for TeamUp](https://www.val.town/v/rayman/mgsrBotEndpoint)
Discord bot built using [val.town](https://www.val.town/v/rayman/mgsrBotEndpoint). Takes user game results posted in a Discord channel and formats them as a /slash command usable with TeamUp, a third-party bot for creating leaderboards for any game with Elo rankings. This Helper Bot eliminates the need to manually type out slash commands.  As of November 2023, this tool is used by a team numerous times per day in a mid-sized gaming server, after its creation in July 2023. This is the successor to the MGSR Discord web tool.

## MGSR Team Up Results Utility
Web tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to aid game results entry with the TeamUp bot, which has its own syntax using Discord /slash commands.
